    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A casserole is a kind of large, deep pan or bowl used for cooking a variety of dishes in the oven; it is also a
        category of foods cooked in such a vessel. To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a "casserole dish"
        or "casserole pan", whereas the food is simply "a casserole". The same pan is often used both for cooking and
        for serving.
