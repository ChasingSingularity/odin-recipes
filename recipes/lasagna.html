        Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ground meats, vegetables,
        cheeses, seasonings and spices like Italian
        seasoning.The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted
        after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients
        and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a strainer with cheese cloth and place over a bowl. Place the ricotta in cheesecloth lined strainer and
            cover the top with more cheesecloth. Then place a heavy object over the top to press the ricotta. This
            process will remove some of the liquid from the ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to box directions but keep them slightly undercooked (cook approximately 7-8
            minutes). They should still have a good bite to them. Rinse and cool. Keep moist while you prepare the rest
            of the dish.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and cook the onions for about two minutes over medium high heat. Add
            the garlic and cook one more minute. Add the meat, stir and cook until there is no pink. Depending on the
            fat content of the meat you are using, you may need to drain off some liquid. There should only be a few
            tablespoons of liquid after cooking the meat. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 teaspoon salt, ¼
            teaspoon pepper, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes and mint. Reduce to medium and simmer ten minutes,
            stirring occasionally. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix drained ricotta, 1 cup shredded mozzarella, beaten eggs, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, 1
            teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper and the chopped parsley. Mix to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees and put oven rack in center of oven.</li>
        <li>In a 9X13X3 glass baking dish, ladle in one cup of tomato sauce into the bottom and lay four lasagna noodles
            overlapping slightly. Add one third of these cheese mixture, one third of the meat mixture and half of the
            sliced fresh mozzarella. (The sliced mozzarella will not cover the whole pan, just spread as evenly as
            possible). Repeat with four more noodles, one third of cheese mixture, one third of meat mixture and the
            other half of sliced fresh mozzarella. Cover with four more noodles and top with remaining cheese mixture,
            remaining meat mixture and 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese. Finish with four more noodles, 1 ½ cups
            tomato sauce, 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella and ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Lay a piece of parchment paper over top and then cover tightly with foil. Cover a sheet pan with foil and
            place a rack in foiled pan. Now place the covered lasagna on the rack and place in the oven. The rack is to
            circulate heat and the lower pan will catch any drips.</li>
        <li>Bake for one hour covered. Remove foil and parchment and cook uncovered for 30 more minutes. Let rest
            15-30minutes before cutting.</li>
        <li>Cut 3X4 for 12 pieces.</li>
