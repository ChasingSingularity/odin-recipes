    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to
        give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle
        iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen
        regional varieties. Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and
        frozen.
